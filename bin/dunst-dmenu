# Wrapper script that filters empty lines from stdin before invoking dmenu(1).  I use this
# to work around what seems to be a bug in dunst(1).  Dunst can use (a variant of) dmenu
# to let the user select from URLs extracted from displayed notifications.  The users
# selection is opened in a browser.  On my system, the input for dmenu contains empty
# lines in addition to the desired URLs.  Dmenu displays both.  I tried to put this
# pipeline directly into my dunstrc but didn't get it to work.  TODO: [report][1] the bug.
