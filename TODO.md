* Sort stuff in `vim/common.vim` and add folds.
* Use `urlview` or one of the [alternatives](http://www.memoryhole.net/~kyle/extract_url/)
  to allow [following][1] [URLs][2] [from][3] [Mutt][4].
* Try these Vim plugins:
  [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki),
  [vim-markdown-folding](https://github.com/nelstrom/vim-markdown-folding),
  [ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim),
  [ag.vim](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim),
  [vim-quicklink](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-quicklink),
  [Projectionist](https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist),
  [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline),
  [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf),
  [vim-pasta](https://github.com/sickill/vim-pasta).
* Mutt asks for my GnuPG passphrase when gpg-agent doesn't need it.  Just hitting `return`
  works when the passphrase is already cached, but how would I know.
