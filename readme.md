I primarily use these dotfiles on Arch Linux, but a lot of what's in here also works on
Ubuntu.  Some of it even works on Windows or macOS.

## Highlights

* There's [a short guide on Fontconfig](home/config/fontconfig/readme.md) and
  [a short guide on X resources](home/xresources/readme.md) in here.
* I have a couple of relevant videos on YouTube:
  * [Demo: Newsboat+mpv as a YouTube Client](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U31niad7bHY)
  * [Some Highlights From My Dotfiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZxo41Ao_Tc)
* Installation uses [GNU Make][].  The configuration for individual programs can be
  installed without any extraneous changes being made.

## Structure

There are three main directories: [`home`](home/), [`root`](root/), and [`misc`](misc/).

* The `home` directory contains files that should be linked to from `$HOME` and mirrors
  its directory structure.
* The `root` directory contains files that should be linked to from *outside* `$HOME`.
  Paths reflect where symlinks should be created relative to the filesystem root
  directory.
* The `misc` directory contains files that don't require linking.

For example, [`home/vim/vimrc`](home/vim/vimrc) would be the target of a link at
`~/.vim/vimrc` and
[`root/usr/local/share/cows/dynamic-duo.cow`](root/usr/local/share/cows/dynamic-duo.cow)
should be linked to from `/usr/local/share/cows/dynamic-duo.cow`.

## Installation

Don't proceed unless you are me.

Clone this repository to `~/dotfiles`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meribold/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

Initialize and clone submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --jobs 32
```

Install the configuration for programs you're interested in by giving Make their names.
The makefile generally doesn't replace conflicting files; move or remove them manually.
For example:

```bash
mv ~/.vim ~/.vim.backup
make vim
```

The currently implemented targets are: `vim`, `nvim`, `git`, `bash`, `screen`, `xterm`,
`gpg`, `crontab`, `fortunes`, `irssi`, and `readline`.

Make may consider targets to be up to date because of existing files that conflict with
the links it should create.  The `-B` flag (e.g. `make -B vim`) forces remaking of all
considered targets.  This only results in the removal of conflicting symlinks, but not
regular files.

Use the `-n` flag (e.g. `make -n vim`) to preview the commands Make would execute.
