Whether you buy Ivory Snow or Tide, they're both owned by Proctor & Gamble.  This doesn't
mean that one takes a position that is without nuance, that [...] the Democrats and
Republicans are the same.  Of course, they're not.  Neither are Tide and Ivory Snow.  Tide
has oxy-boosting and Ivory Snow is a gentle cleanser.

wildlife, poverty, and ultimately mass starvation.

He was the sort of painter who can paint leaves better than trees.  He used to spend a
long time on a single leaf, trying to catch its shape, and its sheen, and the glistening

the same style, and all of them different.
