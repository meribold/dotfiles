! [X resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_resources)
!
! X resources are key-value pairs used for program configuration mediated by the X Window
! System.  They are manipulated by xrdb(1).  Newer programs usually do not use this
! configuration mechanism.
!
! Values are assigned to keys such as `XTerm.termName`.  (capitalization matters!).
! Generally, the keys consist of a bunch of alphanumeric strings separated by dots (.)
! where the first string is a *class* or *instance* name of an application:
!
!    The first element in a resource specification is either a "class" or an "instance".
!    A class consists of ALL the invocations of a particular program.  An instance is a
!    process which is given a particular name.

!
! A fully specified resource may look like this:
!    application.widget.widget.attribute: value
!
! Everything to the left of the colon is the key.  The space between the colon and the
! value seems to be optional.
!
! Class names typically start with a capital letter.  For example, "XTerm" is the default
! resource class for xterms.  The default instance name for xterms is "xterm" (is this
! based on the name of the executable?).
!
! Whether a class name or instance name is used does not seem to matter much.  X resource
! snippets on the web mostly use one or the other randomly without providing any
! reasoning.
!
! While, for example with xterm, both the class name and the instance name can be
! overridden (with the `-class` and `-name` command-line options), I don not think this is
! at all commonly done.
!
! Class names may be intended to be more general.  I will always use class names in this
! file for consistency.
!
! The last string of a key is the *resource name* or *attribute*.  In between can be any
! number of strings referred to as *components* or *widgets*, whose names and relations
! are (probably) defined by the program to be configured.  For example, two widget names
! used by xterm are "vt100" and "tek4014" (class names: "VT100" and "Tek4014").
!
! The keys are actually patterns (sometimes called resource patterns) as two wildcard
! characters can appear anywhere but at the end:
! 1. `*` matches any number of components, including the class or instance name, so this
!    is valid: `*background: black`.
! 2. `?` matches a single component.  The dots still have to be specified.  It seems to be
!    less commonly used than `*`.
