A couple notes about the [desktop entry files][1] (`.desktop` files) in this directory:
*   Official documentation can be found [here][4] and [here][5].
*   [`desktop-file-validate(1)`][6] is useful to find errors and [deprecated keys][3] in
    desktop entry files.
*   There should be desktop entry files in `/usr/share/applications/` which may be useful
    for reference.
