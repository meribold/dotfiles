# Lock all input until my password is supplied but leave everything visible.  There aren't
# many screen-locking programs that work this way.  I previously used xtrlock, but it
# changes the cursor to a hideous lock graphic which isn't configurable.  Now I'm using
# [alock][1], which is "based upon xtrlock" (see the man page) and available in the
# [AUR][2].  (There's also [this fork][3] of xtrlock.)

alock -bg none -i frame:width=1,input=#ffdf87,check=#dfdfdf,error=#ffffff -c glyph:name=X_cursor
