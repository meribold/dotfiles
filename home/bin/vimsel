# vimsel - a simpler [vim-anywhere][1]
#
# TODO:
#
# * vim-anywhere also uses a temporary file to copy the contents of Vim's buffer to the
#   clipboard, but we can probably just use an autocommand instead [4].
# * Don't yank the final newline.
# * Should we use `xclip` or `xsel`?  See [5].

xsel > "$f" &&
# Add a mapping for saving and quitting without leaving insert mode (Control+Q) and start
# insert mode (see [6] and [7]).
