# [Fontconfig][] ðŸ¤·

<!-- TODO
*   Add a footnote saying that this started as a comment explaining my `fonts.conf`...
*   A better way to test the configuration is `fc-match -s`:
        $ fc-match -s serif | head -3
        NotoSerifCJK-Regular.ttc: "Noto Serif CJK TC" "Regular"
        NotoColorEmoji.ttf: "Noto Color Emoji" "Regular"
        NotoSerif-Regular.ttf: "Noto Serif" "Regular"
*   Write that [`fc-match(1)`][] appears to reflect changes to configuration files
    immediately.  That is, it seems running `fc-cache` is usually unnecessary.
-->

Fontconfig is a library that many graphical programs use to figure out what font to use.
A program can ask Fontconfig for a font matching a pattern and Fontconfig *will* return a
font which may or may not be "[anything like the requested pattern][`fonts-conf(5)`]".
The important thing is that we can mess with this matching process using configuration
filesâ€”for example to set default fonts in a way that will work across many programs.

The [`fc-match(1)`][] utility that ships with Fontconfig can be used to test what fonts
are returned for a given pattern:

    $ fc-match
    Ubuntu-R.ttf: "Ubuntu" "Regular"
    $ fc-match serif
    NotoSerifCJK-Regular.ttc: "Noto Serif CJK TC" "Regular"

Since `fc-match` uses "[the normal fontconfig matching rules][`fc-match(1)`]", the above
output implies that (with my configuration) a program that (reasonably) wants to use the
most default font possible will use [Ubuntu][], and a program that wants the default serif
font will use [Noto Serif CJK TC][].

## Configuration

I want to use members of the [Ubuntu][] family as the default sans-serif and monospace
typefaces.  That is, I want `fc-match` to print those when the argument is `sans-serif` or
`monospace`.  Google's [Noto][] font family should be used as the fallback for missing
characters <!-- Is character the correct term here?  What about symbol, glyph, grapheme,
sign, ideograph, ... --> and when a serif typeface is requested.

There are some nuances to this this that make it more tricky than it sounds.

### Major tangent: [Han unification][]

If your system is configured well and has the necessary fonts installed, you will see two
similar but non-identical [Han characters][] here:

<!-- We can't use <span>.  Use a list as a workaround.  See
<https://github.com/github/markup/issues/245#issuecomment-245460087>. -->
<ul>
<li lang="zh">ç·´</li>
<li lang="ja">ç·´</li>
</ul>

*Unicode does not.*  It assigns the same [code point][] (number) to both characters.  The
only reason they (hopefully) look distinct is that I added [`lang`][] attributes to the
list items.  Those two characters can only coexist when additional metadata is
providedâ€”possible on a webpage, but try copying both characters into your browser's
[address bar][], a text editor, or a terminal: I bet they'll look the same.

Relying on additional metadata for correct rendering of text seems like a weird choice in
hindsight, but the consequence that's relevant here is this: choosing a fallback font also
determines which variant of [some Han characters][] will appear in contexts that lack
language metadata.  Plainly using [Noto Sans][], [Noto Serif][], etc. apparently means
that the Japanese [*kanji*][] forms are used.  I want [traditional Chinese characters][]
instead.  Noto includes [Noto Sans CJK TC][] etc. for this purpose.

<!--
I think my best bet for setting up Fontconfig is to specify "Noto San CJK TC" as the first
and "Noto Sans" as an additional fallback font for requests of a sans-serif typeface, and
to do something equivalent for serif and monospace.
-->

### Back to topic (sort of)

It's important to know the order in which Fontconfig loads configuration files.  There
usually are lots in `/etc/fonts/conf.d/` and they interfere with user-specific
configuration.  The only explanation I've found is in the [*Tuning Fontconfig*][] section
of [*Beyond Linux From Scratch*][]: files in `/etc/fonts/conf.d/` have names starting with
a two-digit number followed by a hyphen and smaller numbers are loaded first.

Loading files from the configuration paths specified by [`fonts-conf(5)`][] isn't
intrinsic behavior of Fontconfig.  Instead, the master `/etc/fonts/fonts.conf` file
contains `<include>` directives.  On my
system,<sup>[\[1\]](#user-content-footnote-1)</sup> it only includes files in
`/etc/fonts/conf.d/`, but in there is `50-user.conf` which includes (among other things)
[`~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf`][`fonts.conf`].  The takeaway is that the user-specific
configuration here is loaded sort of after one half and before one half of the system-wide
configuration files.

My configuration file started off based on the one in [this section][fonts-aw-ffo] of the
[*Fonts*][Fonts - ArchWiki] ArchWiki article.  The important parts are `<alias>` elements
such as:

```xml
<alias>
   <family>sans-serif</family>
   <prefer>
      <family>Ubuntu</family>
      <family>Noto Sans CJK TC</family>
      <family>Noto Color Emoji</family>
      <family>Noto Sans</family>
   </prefer>
</alias>
```

The element says: prepend those 4 font families to the list of best-matching fonts in that
order when "sans-serif" is requested.

<!--
Configuration files with numbers that are lower than 50 and that also prepend fonts to
`serif`, `sans-serif`, or `monospace` win.  The fonts they prepend are above the ones I
prepend in the output of `fc-match`.  The file that messes stuff up is
`/etc/fonts/conf.d/30-infinality-aliases.conf`.  I think it does stuff that should really
be done in files with numbers 60 to 69 (see [*Tuning Fontconfig*]; search for "generic
aliases, map generic to family").
-->

This would typically work.  I think.  It didn't quite do it for me, though.  Something
else was also prepending "Noto Sans" with the effect that it ended up at the very top of
the font list.  I identified [`30-infinality-aliases.conf`][], which I got from the
[`fonts-meta-extended-lt`][] package, as the culprit.  It does this:

```xml
<alias>
   <family>sans-serif</family>
   <prefer><family>Noto Sans</family></prefer>
</alias>
```

But wait!  How can <code><b>30</b>-infinality-aliases.conf</code> override an alias that
is ultimately included from <code><b>50</b>-user.conf</code>?  Well, there are two ways in
which one may prepend fonts with Fontconfig and `<prefer>`ing is syntactic sugar for
inserting before the matching `<family>` but not actually at the top.
`30-infinality-aliases.conf` does this before my own configuration and consequently it
wins.<sup>[\[2\]](#user-content-footnote-2)</sup>

We can get around this by using `<prepend_first>`, but have to do without the `<alias>`
shorthand:

```xml
<match target="pattern">
   <test name="family">
      <string>sans-serif</string>
   </test>
   <edit name="family" mode="prepend_first">
      <string>Ubuntu</string>
      <string>Noto Sans CJK TC</string>
      <string>Noto Color Emoji</string>
      <string>Noto Sans</string>
   </edit>
</match>
```

My [`fonts.conf`][] consists of such `<match>` elements for "serif", "sans-serif", and
"monospace".<sup>[\[3\]](#user-content-footnote-3)</sup> We can test the results with the
`-s` flag of `fc-match`:

```bash
$ fc-match -s serif | head -3
NotoSerifCJK-Regular.ttc: "Noto Serif CJK TC" "Regular"
NotoColorEmoji.ttf: "Noto Color Emoji" "Regular"
NotoSerif-Regular.ttf: "Noto Serif" "Regular"
```

```bash
$ fc-match -s sans-serif | head -4
Ubuntu-R.ttf: "Ubuntu" "Regular"
NotoSansCJK-Regular.ttc: "Noto Sans CJK TC" "Regular"
NotoColorEmoji.ttf: "Noto Color Emoji" "Regular"
NotoSans-Regular.ttf: "Noto Sans" "Regular"
```

```bash
$ fc-match -s monospace | head -3
UbuntuMono-R.ttf: "Ubuntu Mono" "Regular"
NotoSansCJK-Regular.ttc: "Noto Sans Mono CJK TC" "Regular"
NotoSansMono-Regular.ttf: "Noto Sans Mono" "Regular"
```
