# Vim Configuration

The main configuration file is [`common.vim`][].  It's used indirectly by both Vim and
Neovim: Vim sources it from [`vimrc`][] and Neovim from [`init.vim`][].

## TODO

*   I think <kbd>;</kbd> (semicolon) and <kbd>,</kbd> (comma) haven't been mapped to
    anything ever since I started using [rhysd's clever-f.vim plugin][1] a [long time
    ago][2].  What a waste.
*   [`common.vim`][] is too big.  Split it into several files.
*   Add `minimal.vim` vimrc file that's used for `git commit` and
    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>X</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>E</kbd> in Bash?
*   Fix warnings when doing `vim -u NORC`.
*   Use `<C-F>` to toggle the quickfix window?
*   Map `<C-B>` to something more useful.
*   Maybe map `<C-G>` to something more useful.
*   Use [`fzf`][] for `z=` suggestions.
*   Use a `'foldexpr'` for Markdown files.
    *   See <http://vimcasts.org/episodes/writing-a-custom-fold-expression/>.
    *   Use a plugin like
        [vim-markdown-folding](https://github.com/nelstrom/vim-markdown-folding)?
*   Is it possible to soft-wrap at `'textwidth'`?  See
    <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/4386>.
*   Use [`par`][] for automatic paragraph formatting?
*   Maybe try some of these Vim plugins:
