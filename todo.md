## Installation

*   Extend `makefile` to set up symlinks for all files that should have them.
*   Add a phony target for each program for which configuration is included.

## [Firefox][]

*   **Custom keybinds** (why is this so damn difficult?)
    *   Keybind that sends the current tab to OneTab.
    *   Use [KeySnail](https://github.com/mooz/keysnail)?  It probably will
        [never][keysnail-issue-220] [work][keysnail-issue-222] in Firefox 57 and later.
*   Use [`userChrome.css`][], [`userContent.css`][], and [`user.js`][] more extensively.
*   Add all my custom CSS (both chrome and content) to the repository.
